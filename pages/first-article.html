        <p>Hundreds of online platforms post traveler reviews, but only a handful police recommendations for fake or
          promotional content. <u>Which ones should you rely on when planning a trip Our expert weighs in.</u></p>
        <i>Any number of concerns are on our radar as we plan our next trip, from serious issues like how destinations
          are working to mitigate tourists&apos; environmental impact to inconveniences like months-long passport wait
          times.
          In this column, our travel expert addresses your questions about how to navigate the world. </i><br>
        <b class="highlight">There are so many online review platforms out there—Google, Tripadvisor, Yelp. When
          I&apos;m planning a trip and
          looking into hotels and activities, which one should I trust the most? —After Good Advice</b>
        <p>
          Online, everyone has an opinion. Even seasoned travelers can find themselves easily led down the rabbit hole
          of online review platforms and come out overwhelmed.

          A friend of mine was recently considering vacationing in Hawaii and interested in the Hana-Maui Resort.
          Five-star reviews on Tripadvisor tout the property as a 2022 Tripadvisor Travelers&apos; Choice winner, with
          comments highlighting it as “Exceptional” and a “Bungalow in Paradise,” though others cautioned, “Not Quite as
          Expected” and “Don&apos;t Stay Here.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When she looked further into the critiques, she discovered that the negative reviews complained of the lack of
          air-conditioning and TVs in rooms (who goes to Maui to watch TV?) and of wind and rain during their stays—the
          latter something no hotel could remedy. Knowing I live part-time on Maui, she reached out to see if I had any
          first-hand intel. The handful of negative comments on varying review sites gave her pause.
